usage: LMICRO <filename> [ /Q | /U ]

/Q means no screen output, 
/U allow apply of older revisions
       

LMICRO is an experiment to see what happends if i update the CPU micro
code of my Intel Pentium III notebook processor. Hope was that
the fan rotates less. This was of course a bad hope.. 
During startup, the BIOS says 'CPU Microcode Update Rev %3xh Complete'
and the cpu micro code loaded by the BIOS is Rev 002.
Sample of running lmicro:

M:\tmp>lmicro.exe 681_1110.cpu
LMicro * load Intel P6+ cpu microcode * Veit Kannegieser * 2003.12.17
Reading CPU ID..
CPU Family/Model/Stepping: 681
Micro code update sign: 00000002
Position Date       ID  Rev
00000000 1999-09-21 681 00000011 Updating..
Micro code update sign: 00000011 - level up.

if you supply no matching cpu microcode, it looks this way:

M:\tmp>lmicro.exe 683_1410.cpu
LMicro * load Intel P6+ cpu microcode * Veit Kannegieser * 2003.12.17
Reading CPU ID..
CPU Family/Model/Stepping: 681
Micro code update sign: 00000011
Position Date       ID  Rev
00000000 2001-02-06 683 00000014
no microcode block applied.


After a reboot, the BIOS shows a micro code version 011, so it
seems to be smart to not write lower versions. lmicro does not
care, you can downlevel with it (option /U).

Requirements
------------

 * CPU must be Intel, and Family 6 or better,
   or
   CPU must be AMD K8 Family 15.
   
 * DOS version of LMICRO needs to have the CPU in real mode
 
 * OS/2 version of LMICRO needs SDDHELP.SYS driver loaded to access
   privileged instructions. Tested version was 2.3 build 420.
   
 * matching microcode blocks
 

Where to find cpu micro code blocks
-----------------------------------
 
Use cpumextr.exe <filename> to extract blocks from bios flash images,
or \os2\boot\resource.sys. For some BIOS types, you will need to unpack
them first (example: use AWARDECO to get CPUCODE.BIN).


     M:\tmp>cpumextr.exe 83-0203m.rom
     Position Date       ID  Rev      Product
     00039280 1999-09-21 681 0000000E 00000020
     00039A81 2000-05-04 686 0000000B 00000020
     0003A282 2000-12-07 68A 00000004 00000020

A huge collection is availabe at my page, program directory, 
files lmicro_intel.arj and lmicro_amd.arj.


improvements
------------

* Maybe write a device driver that reloads micro code on APM resume?
* the program does know nothing about multiprocessor environments.
  updating only one of >=2 is likely a bad idea.
  
  
hint
----

use something like
call=C:\CFG\lmicro.exe C:\CFG\681_1110.cpu /Q
in config.sys to run the program at boot time.

changes
-------

נ 2004.08.05
‏ added /Q - quiet
‏ supports blocks larger than 2048 bytes - untested

נ 2005.07.02
‏ added AMD support. Only have 4 microcode update files...
  because of one AMD update can applied to many different processors,
  the association is defined in lmicro.cfg.
